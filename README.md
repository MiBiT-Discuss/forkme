# forkme
Create havoc by forking fast and breaking the build. Anything legal code fits into here.
The branch to merge into here is "main". Other branches will be ignored. 

Uses: you can clone, create new branches, merge, and push to your fork as you want, then ask for pull requests, then pull all other changes back to your fork as you want.  
You can put any code or (again legal) text into here. The whole isn't supposed to constitute a running project, but code in any language should work either on its own or using existing code.
